_18 May 2023_

Hello, dear users. I'm Gamz, the developer of CropMon. First of all, I'm incredibly excited to be able to deliver this release to you.

I've been working on this in my spare time, 2-3 hours for the past two years (except for the occasional drunken stupor) to bring it to you. It's gone through 24 releases under the alias Kropsaurus, and now I'm officially here as CropMon.

It still has a long way to go. There're a lot of problems to solve and a lot of things I want to do. I'm going to take it one day at a time with unbreakable heart. We're going to see the end of screen recording application's future, so please stay tuned.

Thanks!
